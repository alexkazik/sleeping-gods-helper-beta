# sleeping-gods-helper beta

## beta

This repository and the beta-website will be deleted when the beta is done.

## data

Please use save/load to save you data.

It should be stored in the browser but since this is a beta data may be lost, though I'll try to do my best to let that not happen. (also when the beta is over you have to carry the data yourself to the new website.)

## bugs

If you find a bug you can use the issues here, or pm me.

## major changes

0.0.8/0.0.9 - map: show always all quests (on first page and inside)
